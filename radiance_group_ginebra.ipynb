Next, analyse the same dataset to find average number of days taken for a startup to be funded for each of the aforesaid countries and compare results (While making necessary computations, assume that there are 30 days in each month at an average). Analyse the numerical variable(s) for each of the countries using various measures of central tendencies and spread and report your observations.
