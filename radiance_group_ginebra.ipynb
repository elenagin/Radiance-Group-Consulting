    "For \"Total Funding Raised\" the average funding raised by startups is $14,919,146 USD with an average of 1.7 rounds of funding per startup but it is highly likely that some startups have received exceptionally large funding amounts, which significantly skews the distribution. The mean is much higher than the median, indicating the presence of high-value outliers because probably few startups have received exceptionally large amounts of funding. The mode proves this too because there are many startups with 0 funding (but can also be due to missing data). The variance and range are very large which indicates a presence of outliers at the upper end of the distribution.\n",
